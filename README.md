# Sorting Application
Flutter/Dart application that displays 10 random numbers with three buttons
on the top of the application.
The Ascending and Descending buttons put the list in Descending or Ascending order.
The Add button adds a random number to the list of buttons and if the list of numbers
is in Descending or Ascending order the added random number will be sorted in the
correct location in regards to the other numbers.
 

## Getting Started
